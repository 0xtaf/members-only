# Members-Only Club

- [This app](https://secret-members.herokuapp.com/) was created with Node.js, by using Express framework.  
- The purpose was to implement **session authentication** 
- [Passport.js](https://passportjs.org/) was used for handling session processes.  
- User registration, post saving and session saving were implemented with **Mongo DB**
- Only back-end was used in this project.
- Server Side Rendering is being supplied with [Pug View Engine](https://pugjs.org/)

## What does this site do?

Unauthenticated people can read the posts that were created by the inside members but **cannot** see who wrote them.  
Registration does not make you a member.  
In order to see the posts' owners and create you own posts, joining to the secret club is needed.  

Creating and authenticating users and giving users different abilities and permissions have been practiced.
